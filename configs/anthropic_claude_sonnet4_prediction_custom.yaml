  ðŸ§  VERBAL FLUENCY PREDICTION TASK ðŸ§ 

  You're analyzing human word production patterns in a "{category}" verbal fluency task.

  CURRENT SEQUENCE ({chunk_length} words):
  {chunk_words}

  ðŸŽ¯ YOUR MISSION: Predict if the participant's NEXT word will start a new semantic cluster or continue the current one.

  ðŸ¤” ANALYSIS FACTORS:
  â€¢ Semantic relationships between current words
  â€¢ Typical human clustering strategies (alphabetical, functional, visual, etc.)
  â€¢ Sequence length effects (longer chains = higher switch probability)
  â€¢ Category-specific patterns

  ðŸ“Š PREDICTION RULES:
  â€¢ 1 = SWITCH (next word starts new cluster)
  â€¢ 0 = CONTINUE (next word continues current cluster)

  ðŸ’­ Consider: After {chunk_length} words, how likely is the participant to switch themes?

  Respond with JSON containing:
  {{
    "prediction": 0 or 1,
    "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0,
    "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your prediction logic"
  }}

  IMPORTANT: Your response must be valid JSON only. No other text.
